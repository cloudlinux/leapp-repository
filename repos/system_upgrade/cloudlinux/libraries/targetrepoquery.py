"""The repoquery the CloudLinux checks run against the target repositories.

Those checks run before the upgrade transaction, to predict what the
transaction will be able to install. A prediction is only worth something if
the query reads the repositories the transaction will read, and the query
therefore runs where the transaction does: inside the target userspace.

The CloudLinux mirrorlist decides that, not the repofile. It answers by the
client's own release, which it reads from dnf's User-Agent, not by the channel
the URL names; and dnf builds that User-Agent from the /etc/os-release of the
root it runs in, never from --installroot. dnf on a CloudLinux 8 source sends
"CloudLinux 8.10", so .../cloudlinux-x86_64-server-9.8 comes back as the 8.10
channel. Run that way, the essential-package check saw only el8 builds of
lve-stats3 and inhibited every CloudLinux 8 to 9 upgrade over a package the
transaction installs.

Everything else is already on the right side of this. target_userspace_creator
installs the target cloudlinux-release into the source overlay before it builds
the userspace (_install_cloudlinux_release), so dnf there reports the target
release, and the transaction runs inside the target userspace.

The query also keeps its own metadata cache, because dnf reuses cached metadata
whatever release the client now reports: what another dnf call left in the
userspace's /var/cache/dnf would be read back unchanged. QUERY_CACHEDIR is inside
the target userspace, which is rebuilt on every leapp run, so only these queries
ever fill it.

The container runs with SYSTEMD_SECCOMP=0 when the target is 9, as dnfplugin's
own nspawn calls do. systemd 239 on a CloudLinux 8 source filters clone3, which
the el9 glibc uses to create threads, so inside the el9 userspace dnf cannot
start libcurl's resolver thread ("getaddrinfo() thread failed to start"). Every
repository then fails to download, skip_if_unavailable hides it, and every
query answers nothing at all.

--releasever is the target version, as the DNF plugin gives the transaction.
skip_if_unavailable keeps one unreachable repository from failing every query:
the target userspace inherits the source system's repofiles, and a stale one -
cl-mysql, whose baseurl interpolates $releasever and 404s on the target - makes
dnf exit 1 for any query at all.
