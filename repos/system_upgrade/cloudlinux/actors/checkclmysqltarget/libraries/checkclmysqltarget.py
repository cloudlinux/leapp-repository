Two variants are decided here, each by its own rule: a Governor-managed series
by whether CloudLinux publishes it for the target, and the operating system's
own server by whether the settled transaction removes it with no successor.
Vendor MySQL/MariaDB is decided earlier, in cl_mysql_repository_setup, where
its repository URL is known. A variant is never swapped for another.
