"""
Detect a target-repository state where the available kernel's minor version
is greater than the available `cloudlinux-release`'s minor version.

This is the gradual-rollout-leak shape behind CLOS-3716 (ZD 268790): the CLN
package channel `cloudlinux-x86_64-server-9` resolves to the latest minor
available to a system's gradual-rollout slot, and a new minor's kernel is
typically promoted ahead of the rest of the userland.  During an in-flight
rollout, elevate can therefore pull a 9.7 kernel onto a 9.6 userland; the
matching kmod-lve is built per kernel minor, so the new default-boot kernel
fails to load kmodlve and breaks LVE.

The actor consuming this library inhibits at Checks phase whenever the
target repositories expose this mismatch, so the upgrade refuses to proceed
while rollout content is in flight.  This is defense in depth - it catches
the leak regardless of which CL repo (CLN channel, no-auth fallback, etc.)
ends up serving the newer-minor kernel.
